ðŸ¤– **Check out my [CV Chatbot](https://cvchatbot-rafabastidasr.streamlit.app/)** 


I'm Rafaela, an economist and data scientist originally from Ecuador, now residing in Washington DC.

I'm driven to harness the power of data as a tool for tackling complex, unstructured problems. Through the application of methodologies like econometrics and text analysis, I strive to uncover innovative solutions and drive positive change. Currently, I work as a Consultant the headquarters of the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en), at the Strategic Planning and Development Effectiveness Office (SPD). 

I completed my undergraduate studies in economics at the [Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador](https://www.puce.edu.ec/), and obtained a degree in economics and Management from [UniversitÃ© Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr). Subsequently, I engaged in various consultancy projects across public sector institutions like the Ministry of Economics and Finance and the National Institute of Statistics and Census in Ecuador, jointly with Multilateral Development Banks such as the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home) and the [Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean](https://www.caf.com/en/). Through these experiences, I came to recognize the crucial role of leveraging data and adopting cutting-edge methodologies to effectively address complex challenges and make well-informed, evidence-based decisions.

In 2021, I received the [Chevening Scholarship](https://www.chevening.org/scholarships/), a fully-funded program aimed at nurturing leaders from across the globe. This opportunity enabled me to pursue my Master's degree in Data Science at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) offered by the Statistics Department. I was granted a fellowship by the [KDI School of Public Policy and Management](https://www.kdischool.ac.kr/gallery.es?mid=a30101000000&bid=0003&list_no=17451&act=view) in 2024 to further enhance my skills in navigating the rapidly changing environment and exercising global leadership.
