I'm Rafaela, an economist and data scientist originally from Ecuador, now residing in Washington DC.

Currently, I work as a Consultant the headquarters of the [Inter-American Development Bank](https://www.iadb.org/en), at the Strategic Planning and Development Effectiveness Office (SPD). My role primarily involves applied research, focusing on applying methodologies—such as econometric and text analysis—to tackle unstructured problems.

I completed my undergraduate studies in economics at the Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador, and obtained a degree in economics and Management from [Université Grenoble Alpes](https://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr). Subsequently, I engaged in various consultancy projects across public sector institutions like the Ministry of Economics and Finance and the National Institute of Statistics and Census in Ecuador, jointly with Multilateral Development Banks such as the [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/home) and the [Development Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean](https://www.caf.com/en/). Through these experiences, I recognized the importance of enhancing my technical skills in data handling and adopting cutting-edge methodologies to address complex challenges effectively.

In 2021, I was privileged to receive the [Chevening Scholarship](https://www.chevening.org/scholarships/), a fully-funded program aimed at nurturing leaders from across the globe. This opportunity enabled me to pursue my Master's degree in Data Science at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/) offered by the Statistics Department.
